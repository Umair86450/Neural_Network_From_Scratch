# 🧠 Simple Neural Network Backpropagation (from Scratch)

A basic implementation of a feedforward neural network with **backpropagation** in Python, written completely from scratch using only the built-in `math` module. Ideal for learning how neural networks work under the hood — no libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch used.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Forward propagation in a neural network
- Calculation of output errors
- Backpropagation to update weights using gradient descent
- Manual implementation of the **sigmoid activation function** and its derivative
- A **single iteration** of training on a simple 2-input, 2-output dataset

## 📐 Architecture

Input Layer (2 Neurons)

Output Layer (2 Neurons)


Each layer uses the **sigmoid activation function**. Biases are included for both hidden and output layers.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python (Core)
- math module (for exp)
- No external libraries — everything is coded manually for clarity and learning
